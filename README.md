   ```

### 4. Access the Application

- Django backend will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
- React frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

- **Log In or Create an Account**: Access the application by logging in with your username and password by clicking on the **`Accedi`** button in the middle of the page. *An account is required to use all features of the application*.

- **Manage Passwords**: After logging in, navigate to the **`Cassaforte`** section in the top Navbar to manage your personal passwords. You can view, add, or delete your saved passwords.

- **Generate a Secure Password**: If you want to add a new password but donâ€™t know what to use, go to the **`Generatore di Password`** section in the Navbar. This tool allows you to generate a strong and efficient security key.

- **Update Profile Settings**: To update your user profile settings, click on the icon in the top-right corner and select the **`Your Profile`** section. Here, you can modify your email, add your phone number, or change your profile image.

- **Log Out**: Once you are done using the application, click on the icon in the top-right corner and select **`Logout`** to securely log out.

## Development Notes

- **Authentication**: Use JWT tokens for user authentication, storing them securely.
- **API**: APIs are protected, so each request requires an authentication token. Axios is configured to automatically add the token.

## Future Features

- **Two-Factor Authentication**: To guarantee even more security for users, in the future we will implement two-factor authentication to access your personal account.
- **Push Notifications**: To warn you that your passwords may no longer be secure, in the future we will implement the ability to send push notifications.
